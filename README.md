# Mississippi Records B2B

Mississippi Records B2B is a business-to-business Ruby on Rails application for the beloved Portland-based record store/ label/ distributer Mississippi Records.

> As hackneyed and precious as it may be interpreted, we actually believe that records can be  powerful hoodoo totemistic and utilitarian objects that can further the development of culture, revolution and spirituality. They can be more than just cultural commodities.  
â€“ Eric Isaacson, Mississippi Records
